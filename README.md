# Conformal-Learning

This is the code accompanying the paper "Training Uncertainty-Aware Classifiers with Conformalized Deep Learning". This code includes the package implementing our methods and some alternative benchmarks and experiments with different datasets. 

## contents:
•	experiments_cifar10- Code for the experiments with cifar10 dataset discussed in the accompanying paper.\
•	experiments_credit_synthetic_data- Code for the experiments with synthetic data and credit card dataset discussed in the accompanying paper.

## Prerequisites
We provided the code that runs all experiment on our servers. In order to run the experiments, the prerequisites are:\
•	numpy\
•	torch\
•	tqdm\
•	panda\
•	matplotlib\
•	sys\
•	os\
•	sklearn\
•	torchsort\
•	scipy
